# Monitoring Google Maps API Usage and Costs in (Near) Real Time

You **can get fairly close to real-time monitoring** of your Google Maps Platform (and other Google Cloud) API usage and
costs, though there are some caveats. Here’s a detailed breakdown of your options:

---

## 1. Google Cloud Console (Web Interface)

### A. API Usage Monitoring

- **Go to:** [Google Cloud Console API Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
- **Features:**
    - See requests per API (e.g., Maps, Geocoding, Places, etc.).
    - Granular breakdown by method, per minute/hour/day.
    - Filter by project, time range, etc.
- **Latency:**
    - **Near real-time:** Data is usually updated within minutes, but sometimes up to a 5-15 minute delay.

### B. Cost Monitoring

- **Go to:** [Google Cloud Billing Reports](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
- **Features:**
    - See cost per API, per project, per day.
    - Visual graphs, filters, and CSV export.
    - Set budgets and alerts.
- **Latency:**
    - **Not strictly real-time:** Typically updated every few hours, sometimes up to 24 hours for cost data.

---

## 2. Budgets and Alerts

- **Set up budgets:**
    - [Create a budget and alert](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets)
    - Get email or Pub/Sub notifications when spending hits thresholds (e.g., 50%, 90%, 100% of budget).
- **Web Interface:**
    - Manage and view budgets/alerts in the Billing section.

---

## 3. Custom Dashboards (for More Real-Time Monitoring)

### A. Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver)

- **Go to:** [Google Cloud Monitoring](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring)
- **Features:**
    - Create custom dashboards showing API usage metrics.
    - Use pre-built metrics or custom logs-based metrics.
    - Can get as granular as per-minute usage.
- **Latency:**
    - Data is generally available within minutes.

### B. BigQuery Export (for Advanced Users)

- Export billing data to BigQuery for custom analysis and dashboards.
- Connect BigQuery to [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) (formerly Data Studio) for web-based visual
  dashboards.
- **Latency:**
    - Exported data is typically updated multiple times a day, not strictly real-time.

---

## 4. API-Based Monitoring (for Automation)

- **Cloud Billing API:**
    - [Cloud Billing API](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/apis)
    - Programmatically get cost and usage data.
    - Integrate with your own web dashboard or monitoring tools.
    - **Note:** Cost data is not real-time, but usage metrics can be close.

- **Cloud Monitoring API:**
    - [Monitoring API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest)
    - Query metrics for API usage in near-real-time.

## Summary Table

| Method                      | Usage Data | Cost Data        | Web Interface?             | Real-Time?                             |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cloud Console API Dashboard | Yes        | No               | Yes                        | Near real-time (minutes)               |
| Cloud Console Billing       | No         | Yes              | Yes                        | Delayed (hours)                        |
| Cloud Monitoring            | Yes        | No               | Yes                        | Near real-time (minutes)               |
| Budgets/Alerts              | No         | Yes (thresholds) | Yes                        | Delayed (hours)                        |
| BigQuery Export + Looker    | Yes/Yes    | Yes/Yes          | Yes                        | Delayed (hours)                        |
| APIs (Billing/Monitoring)   | Yes        | Limited          | No (but you can build one) | Near real-time (usage), delayed (cost) |

## Recommended Approach

For most users **wanting a web interface and near real-time usage monitoring**:

1. **Use the [API Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)** for per-API usage.
2. **Set up [Cloud Monitoring](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring) dashboards** for more granular, custom
   visualizations.
3. **Set up Budgets & Alerts** for cost overruns.
4. **Check Billing Reports** for cost, realizing it will lag by a few hours.
5. **(Optional)** Export billing data to BigQuery and visualize with Looker Studio for custom reports.

### Example: Monitoring Google Maps API Usage

1. **Go to Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Dashboard**
2. Select your project.
3. Filter for “Maps JavaScript API,” “Geocoding API,” etc.
4. View request counts, errors, latency, etc.

For more advanced, near-real-time dashboards (e.g., per-minute usage), use **Cloud Monitoring**:

- Go to Monitoring > Metrics Explorer.
- Search for “API request count” or relevant metric.
- Build a dashboard.

---

## Limitations

- **Usage metrics:** Near real-time (minutes).
- **Cost metrics:** Delayed (hours, sometimes up to a day).
- **No 100% real-time cost data** due to Google’s billing pipeline.
